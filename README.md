# Julia-tutorials-for-ChEs
This repository contains tutorials for the Julia programming language that are especially tailored for chemical and biochemical engineers 
(ChEs and BioChEs). In addition, the tutorials here emphasize the use of ModelingToolkit.jl for solving problems of interest to ChEs 
and BioChEs. Although many tutorials exist for the Julia programming language, none are not focused on ChE and BioChE applications, 
and most are a little short on using effective pedagogical methods to make learning easy (or at least easier!). The tutorials 
here seek to address these needs.
